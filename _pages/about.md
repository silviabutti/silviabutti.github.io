## Bio 

**I am a mathematician working in theoretical computer science.** Currently, I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Computer Science at King's College London, [Department of Informatics](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/informatics).  

Previously, I was a Senior Research Associate at the University of Oxford, working with [Standa Živný](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/standa.zivny/) within the ERC project [NAASP](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/standa.zivny/naasp.html). Concurrently, I held a Junior Research Fellowship at [Lady Margaret Hall](https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/).  

I obtained my PhD from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, ES) under the supervision of [Victor Dalmau](https://www.upf.edu/web/victor-dalmau) within the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning research group. Previously, I obtained an MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science ([MFoCS](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/students/postgraduate-courses/msc-mfocs)) from the University of Oxford (2018) and a BSc in Mathematics from University College London (2017).
